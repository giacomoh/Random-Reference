Hi, this is a program for selecting and displaying images.
It will ask you to select a folder the first time, after that it will create txt file to remember the last folder you picked.
You can rotate, fip, zoom move around add a couple of filters, etc
If you apply multiple filters at once they might break, clicking reset will return everything to how it should be.

I tried a bunch of other programs like this, but there were always features that i didn't like. 
I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER, this is held together by duct tape and broken dreams, and the code is at least 60% written by the github AI assistant.
If you'd like to add features or help me fix something you can make a PR!
