# Info

Hi, this is a program for randomly selecting and displaying images.
It will ask you to select a folder the first time you run this, then it will create txt file in its same folder to remember the last folder you chose.
There's a timer, you can rotate, fip, zoom move around add a couple of filters, etc
If you apply multiple filters at once they might break, clicking reset will return everything to how it should be.

It's just a python script so i'm not converting it into an EXE, just click on it.

I tried a bunch of other programs like this, but there were always features that i didn't like. 
I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER, this is held together by duct tape and broken dreams, and the code is at least 60% written by the github AI assistant.

Here are the python requirements to run:

tkinter

customtkinter == 5.2.2

darkdetect    == 0.8.0

numpy         == 1.26.4

opencv-python == 4.9.0.80

pillow        == 10.2.0

scipy         == 1.12.0

You won't need to CMD install them if you use the EXE file.
But if you don't want to install and run it, you can use the python script.
just download the latest python version, then open your CMD and >pip install X (where X is pillow, customtkinter, tkinter, etc)

# To do
- smoother image movement (lags slightly on larger files)
- ???

If you have any features you'd like to see added you can message me or open a pull request!
