# Info

This is a WINDOWS ONLY application that allows you to look at and edit images.
It will load random images from a selected folder in the correct color space of the image (srgb, adobe rgb, etc), load a new one when the timer is done, etc.
The posterization and grayscale are optimised to account for human perception.
You can add multiple filters to each other, and even copy the image the way that it looks in the application.
