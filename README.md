# Info

Hi, this is a program for randomly selecting and displaying images.
It will ask you to select a folder the first time you run this, then it will remember it.
It always runs on top of all other windows, there's a timer, you can rotate, fip, zoom move around add a couple of filters, etc
If you apply multiple filters at once they might break, clicking reset will return everything to how it was. I'm still fixing those.

I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER, this is held together by duct tape and broken dreams, and the code is at least 60% written by Github Copilot.

# To do

- rewrite this but in C++ when i have some more free time, looks like i underestimated how intensive this program would end up being. it's not bad but i'd like it to support better color profiles and downscaling, things that python libraries aren't really good at apparently.
- zoom slider, for when you need something more precise than the scroll wheel
If you have any features you'd like to see added you can message me or open a pull request!
