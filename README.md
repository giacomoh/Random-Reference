# Info

Hi, this is a program for randomly selecting and displaying images.
The first time you open it, it will ask you a folder from which to pick the images. Afterwards it will remember it.
You can view images, flip them, add a bunch of filters and more.
Since i moved from python to c++ it's able to read the image color profiles (ICCs) and show them automatically images that used to look dull on the old app now look better.

Keep everything in the same folder! When installing too you will need to keep the MSI file and the EXE file in the same folder. 

To download click on the setup.exe and set the install location.
To uninstall click on setup.exe and click then select uninstall.

# To do

- image rotation
- more file supported (for now all the popular files are supported: pngs, jpgs, webps, etc)
- better posterize, for my needs it's ok but it messes with smaller resolution images right now.
- i need to make it look cooler!
