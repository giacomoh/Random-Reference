Hi, this is a program for selecting and displaying images.
It will ask you to select a folder the first time, after that it will create txt file to remember the last folder you picked (in the same folder you put the file in).
You can rotate, fip, zoom move around add a couple of filters, etc
If you apply multiple filters at once they might break, clicking reset will return everything to how it should be.

It's just a python script so i'm not converting it into an EXE, just click on it.

I tried a bunch of other programs like this, but there were always features that i didn't like. 
I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER, this is held together by duct tape and broken dreams, and the code is at least 60% written by the github AI assistant.
If you'd like to add features or help me fix something you can make a PR!
