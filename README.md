# Info

Hi, this is a program for randomly selecting and displaying images.
It will ask you to select a folder the first time you run this, then it will remember it.
There's a timer, you can rotate, fip, zoom move around add a couple of filters, etc
If you apply multiple filters at once they might break, clicking reset will return everything to how it should be. I'm still fixing those.

I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER, this is held together by duct tape and broken dreams, and the code is at least 60% written by Github Copilot.

# To do

- rewrite this but for C++, looks like i underestimated how intensive on the CPU this program would end up being ðŸ˜“

If you have any features you'd like to see added you can message me or open a pull request!
